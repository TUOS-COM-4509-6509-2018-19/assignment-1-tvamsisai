    "# Probability and an Introduction to Jupyter, Python and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29th September 2015 Neil Lawrence\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and data science. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook provides us with a way of interacting with the data that allows us to give the computer instructions and explore the nature of a data set. It is *different* to normal coding, but it is related. In this course you will, through intensive practical sessions and labs, develop your understanding of the interaction between data and computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we are going to do is ask you to forget a bit about what you think about normal programming, or 'classical software engineering'. Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as *exploratory data analysis*. You will learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular difference between classical software engineering and data analysis is the way in which programs are run. Classically we spend a deal of time working with a text editor, writing code. Compilations are done on a regular basis and aspects of the code are tested (perhaps with unit tests). \n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is more like coding in a debugger. In a debugger (particularly a visual debugger) you interact with the data stored in the memory of the computer to try and understand what is happening in the computer, you need to understand exactly what your bug is: you often have a fixed idea of what the program is trying to do, you are just struggling to find out why it isn't doing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, debugging is an important part of data analysis also, but in some sense it can be seen as its entire premise. You load in a data set into a computer that you don't understand, your entire objective is to understand the data. This is best done by interogating the data to visualise it or summarize it, just like in a power visual debugger. However, for data science the requirements for visualization and summarization are far greater than in a regular program. When the data is well understood, the actual number of lines of your program may well be very few (particularly if you disregard commands that load in the data and commands which plot your results). If a powerful data science library is available, you may be able to summarize your code with just two or three lines, but the amount of intellectual energy that is expended on writing those three lines is far greater than in standard code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first lecture we will think a little about 'how we got here' in terms of computer science. In the lecture itself, this will be done by taking a subjective perspective, that of my own 'data autobiography'."

    "\n",
    "### Linear Algebra, Probability and Differential Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be assuming that you have good background in maths. In particular we will be making use of linear algrebra (matrix operations including inverse, inner products, determinant etc), probability (sum rule of probability, product rule of probability), and the calculus of differentiation (and integration!). A new concept for the course is multivariate differentiation and integration. This combines linear algebra and differential calculus. These techniques are vital in understanding probability distributions over high dimensional distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice of Language\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be using Python for our programming language. A prerequisite of attending this course is that you have learnt at least one programming language in the past. It is not our objective to teach you python. At Level 4 and Masters we expect our students to be able pick up a language as they go. If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) that are based on the standard console. An introduction to the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is available [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/notebook/index.html). "

    "We are working in the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook). It provides an environment for interacting with data in a natural way which is reproducible. We will be learning how to make use of the notebook throughout the course. The notebook allows us to combine code with descriptions, interactive visualizations, plots etc. In fact it allows us to do many of the things we need for data science. Notebooks can also be easily shared through the internet for ease of communication of ideas. The box this text is written in is a *markdown* box. Below we have a *code* box."

    "For our first example of data science, we take inspiration from work by [researchers at NJIT](http://www.theswarmlab.com/r-vs-python-round-2/). They researchers were comparing the qualities of Python with R (my brief thoughts on the subject are available in a Google+ post here: https://plus.google.com/116220678599902155344/posts/5iKyqcrNN68).

The result of this command on its own is a data series of `True` and `False` values. However, when it is passed to the `film_deaths` data frame it returns a new data frame which contains only those values for which the data series is `True`. We can also sort the result. To sort the result by the values in the `Body_Count` column in *descending* order we use the following command."

    "#### Question 2 Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is a library of functions to ease the use of multidimentional arrays and other high-level mathematical functions in Python. As the name suggests, it is used to help with numerical computations and applications.<sup>[1](https://www.numpy.org/)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib provides generation of figures and charts in Python and in numpy interfaces.<sup>[2](https://matplotlib.org/)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy is an extension of numpy to ease perfoming scientific computations in Python. Scipy provides functions to compute integration, FFT, interpolation, image processing, optimisation.<sup>[2](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/general.html)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a data transformation and analysis library in Python. It can help the user to filter, sort and reshape data sets. It also can perform manipulations to time-series data with some date and time specific functions.<sup>[3](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pylab is a set of libraries and tools that allow easy mathematical computation and data analysis. It consists of the libraries NumPy and Matplotlib in the same namespace. It is also used by invoking `%pylab`, as a \"magic function\", in an IPython session to import the two constituent libraries.<sup>[4](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20961407/1362833)</sup>\n",

    "Note a few things. We are interacting with our data. In particular, we are replotting the data according to what we have learned so far. We are using the progamming language as a *scripting* language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a *console*. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The *state* of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.  "

    "#### Question 3 Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is an interactive computing environment pioneering in notebook format development paradigm. It was created \"to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages\".<sup>[1](http://jupyter.org/about)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "As an interactive computing environment, it allows plotting of the data that is worked on with an easy interface. Jupyter also allows sharing of session state and retention of results even after session is closed. A major advantage in most usecases is the ability to write notes and mathematical comments along with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Jupyter is a spin-off of the IPython project, keeping the notebook capabilities seperate from the language dependencies. It also helped marketing the language agnostic vision of the project.<sup>[2](https://speakerdeck.com/fperez/project-jupyter)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several dozens of programming languages supported by the project. Haskell and Julia are two programming languages other than Python, that Jupyter supports.<sup>[3](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)</sup>\n",

    "## Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to do some simple review of probabilities and use this review to explore some aspects of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution expresses uncertainty about the outcome of an event. We often encode this uncertainty in a variable. So if we are considering the outcome of an event, $Y$, to be a coin toss, then we might consider $Y=1$ to be heads and $Y=0$ to be tails. We represent the probability of a given outcome with the notation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y=1) = 0.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The first rule of probability is that the probability must normalize. The sum of the probability of all events must equal 1. So if the probability of heads ($Y=1$) is 0.5, then the probability of tails (the only other possible outcome) is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y=0) = 1-P(Y=1) = 0.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilities are often defined as the limit of the ratio between the number of positive outcomes (e.g. *heads*) given the number of trials. If the number of positive outcomes for event $y$ is denoted by $n_y$ and the number of trials is denoted by $N$ then this gives the ratio \n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y=y) = \\lim_{N\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{n_y}{N}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In practice we never get to observe an event infinite times, so rather than considering this we often use the following estimate\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y=y) \\approx \\frac{n_y}{N}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Let's use this rule to compute the approximate probability that a film from the movie body count website has over 40 deaths."

    "#### Question 4 Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "As we find from the histogram plotted earlier, there are more than 250 movies that don't have a death count greater than 40. Out of the total of 421 movies that we are analysing, the highest deaths found is 836 deaths in only one movie. That is, more than half of the movies don't have number of deaths > 40. Moreover, the highest death count is more than the sample set of movies that we have. Clearly, evaluating an average with a small sample set gives us the above probabilty of finding 40 or more deaths in nearly 38% of the movies. Hence, it is unusual to conclude that the probability of nearly 38% even though in practice it seems to be lesser than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `float` around counts of deaths and total films to explicitly *type cast* the variables. A variable or constant in Python is said to be type casted when the datatype of the variable/constant is converted from one to another. When we don't type cast (in other words, don't enclose the variables in parantheses) the Python interpreter will do its best to keep the precision of the computation. In the above scenario when we remove the type casts we find the precision of the result has decreased by half than if we would have type casted."

    "# Conditioning\n",
    "\n",
    "When predicting whether a coin turns up head or tails, we might think that this event is *independent* of the year or time of day. If we include an observation such as time, then in a probability this is known as *conditioning*. We use this notation, $P(Y=y|T=t)$, to condition the outcome on a second variable (in this case time). Or, often, for a shorthand we use $P(y|t)$ to represent this distribution (the $Y=$ and $T=$ being implicit). Because we don't believe a coin toss depends on time then we might write that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y|t) = p(y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "However, we might believe that the number of deaths is dependent on the year. For this we can try estimating $P(Y>40 | T=2000)$ and compare the result, for example to $P(Y>40|2002)$ using our empirical estimate of the probability."

We may notice that the older years have absolute or near absolute values. This must be because there significatly lesser number of movies from that year than in the years later to 1980.

We represent a joint probability using the notation $P(Y=y, T=t)$ or $P(y, t)$ for short. Computing a joint probability is equivalent to answering the simultaneous questions, what's the probability that the number of deaths was over 40 and the year was 2002? Or any other question that may occur to us. Again we can easily use pandas to ask such questions.\n"

    "With the several features that we have to help us predict a movie's rating, we would want to fit the prediction against the available ratings. This happens to be a regression problem, as we would need to fit the available features on a continuous distribution on any newly given movie to predict the rating for. Hence, a linear regression model with a regression function that takes the available features as input parameters and result a predicted rating. However, we find that there are some features that are categorical in nature. For such features, we would have a binary parameter for each category. For example, a movie of genres Action, Thriller, and Drama we will have $x_{action} = 1$, $x_{thriller} = 1$, $x_{drama} = 1$ and all other genre parameters set to $0$ to solve for the solution.\n",

This makes the distribution we will test the ratings to be discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the ratings are continuous on $[0, 10]$. We can reach the right _x_ to approach by a divide and conquer approach. We can keep dividing the the range in halves. The first objective will be to find if the rating is higher than or equal to 5, or less than a rating of 5. We find \"what is the probability of the rating of a _new movie_ can be between 0 and 5 given the _properties of the new movie_?\" Along with \"what is the probability of the rating of a _new movie_ can be greater than 5 given the _properties of the new movie_?\" Will go ahead keep subdividing the half which has the higher probability to reach to an appropriate rating range, possibly in one decimal range.\n",
